🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - AutoAI

📌 Overview
The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a Machine Learning-based project built using IBM Watson AutoAI. It automates the process of identifying and classifying network traffic as either normal or anomalous, helping to detect potential cybersecurity threats in real-time or offline analysis.

This project leverages AutoAI's automated pipeline generation to:

Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Automatically select the best algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
Optimize hyperparameters for maximum detection accuracy.
🚀 Features
✅ Automated machine learning pipeline creation using AutoAI
✅ Handles categorical encoding, scaling, and feature transformations
✅ Evaluates multiple models and selects the best-performing pipeline
✅ High detection accuracy for identifying anomalous traffic
✅ Ready to be deployed as a REST API endpoint for real-time monitoring
